    <style>
        body {margin: 9rem 0}
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is heading of level 1: </h1>
    <p>&lt;h1&gt;Heading 1 &lt;/h1&gt; </p>
    <h2>This is heading of level 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading of level 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading of level 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading of level 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading of level 6</h6>
    
    <p>
        we have the paragraph tag, it is used for paragraphs and text that isn't heading
    </p>

    <p> we have something called "Lorem", it is used for generating sample texts. You can also specify the length by adding it to the "lorem", eg: "lorem10" means 10 words.</p>

    <p>
        We have the "b" tag <b>this is special</b>

        The b element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.
    </p>

    <i>this is important</i>
    <p>
        The i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            Div is just a container with nothing really special.
            it can be used to draw circle, triangle etc.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        the break tag is a SELF CLOSING tag that is used for thematic break, i.e to go to next line. it isn't a pair <br> OR <br/> That is break tag for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists in HTML</h2>
    <p>We basically have 3 types of list in HTML, NAMELY: ul (unordered list), OL(ordered list) and dl(for definition list).</p>

    <!-- UNORDERED LIST -->
    <ul>
        <li>List item 1</li>
        <li> item 2</li>
        <li>item 3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- ORDERED LIST -->
    <ol>
        <li>List item 1</li>
        <li> item 2</li>
        <li>item 3</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- CREATING LINK TO A WEBPAGE -->
    <p>
        We use the anchor tag to create links to other pages.
        &lt; a &gt; &lt; /a &gt;
        eg: <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>.
        
    </p>

    <!-- WRITING HTML TAGS AS PLAIN TEXT -->
    <p>
        replace "<" with "&lt;" and then the closing ">" with & gt;
        &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    </p>
